# MatLab Interface and RL Environment for X-Plane 9

This repo contains an X-Plane 9 interface class for MatLab that allows reading aircraft state and sending various commands and data. It also includes a MatLab rl.env.MATLABEnvironment class for doing reinforcement learning with X-Plane as the environment, and a sample program that uses it to train a PPO agent.

Some hints to make sure you have X-Plane set up for this to work are included in the files. More in-depth documentation on how everything works can be found in the 4th year final report I wrote for this, if you have access to that.

If you have any problems getting this code to work, please do contact me.
